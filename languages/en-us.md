## ‚öôÔ∏è Deploys

Here's the preview for the application: [link](#)

### Details of the deploy

As for the deployment I used the service provided by Vercel (BFF) by creating a separate branch with the API code inside the Next API route. The reason as to why I made this choice is because Backend services are slightly limited and they can take down you cluster at any time, at least the free plans. Database wise, I used the service provided by Planet Scale.

## üßµ How to use

In case you want to run the application locally, I'd recommend following these steps:

<br />

Cloning the repository

```bash
git clone [repo-url]
```

Downloading the dependencies with PNPM

```bash
pnpm install
```

Running the project locally

```bash
docker compose up -d && pnpm run dev
```

To access the project locally, all that you have to do is open this link in your browser

```md
http://localhost:3000 #front-end
http://localhost:3333 #back-end
```

<br />

### Packages

The use of a Monorepo is to facilitate the development of multiple applications at once

#### Domain (Clean architecture with DDD)

Decoupling the business logic, assisting the application scale, and it also helps during the changes of Frameworks and ORMs

`Folder moved to back-end project with no changes, keeping the code intact`

#### Linter config (Biome.js)

It keeps the configuration of the linter for the Monorepo

#### Typescript config

It keeps the configuration of the Typescript for the Monorepo

<br />

### Others

- Vitest (testing)
- Biome.js (linting)
- Typescript (superset for type safety)
